# hexagon server

This is the web server for the game. It will serve the frontend and proxy request from
players to connected engines. Engines will use websockets to communicate with the server,
while clients will be sending regular HTTP requests.

## Requirements

You should have at least Node 8.10.0.

## Setup with Visual Studio Code

Configure default build and test tasks by pasting this into `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Start",
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "dev",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Test",
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "test:watch",
      "group": {
        "kind": "test",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Configure the debugger to attach to a running Node process by pasting this into `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to Node",
      "address": "localhost",
      "port": 5858,
      "restart": true,
      "protocol": "inspector"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Start a development server with automatic restart:

```
npm run dev
```

Build the project:

```
npm run build
```

Test the project (optionally with coverage or in watch mode):

```
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:watch
```

Format the code with Prettier:

```
npm run format
```

Lint the code with TSLint:

```
npm run lint
```

## Git hooks

The project contains a pre-commit git hook which checks the code with Prettier and a pre-push hook for checking TSLint. You can disable these hooks by adding `--no-verify` flag to your `git commit` or `git push` command.

## Docker

You can build the project as a Docker image with a standard `docker build` command. The commands below let you quickly build and run the example on port 80:

```
docker build -t node-ts:latest .
docker run --rm -it -p 80:8080 --pid=host node-ts:latest
```

The server should be available under your Docker machine address, for example:

```
http://localhost/hello/World
```

The container will be removed when you press `Ctrl+C`.
